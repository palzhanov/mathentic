Static page for collecting math problems with linked YouTube solutions. Open `index.html` in a browser to view it.

### Editing the problem list
- Update or add entries inside `main.js` in the `sections` array (title, focus, difficulty, tags, videoUrl).
- Add or remove entire sections by adjusting the objects in the same array.
- No build step is required—reload the page to see changes.
